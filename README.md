Dynamic excel-based employee attendance tracker with automation
Employee Attendance Management System (Excel Project)

Overview :
This project is a dynamic Employee Attendance Management System built using Microsoft Excel.
It is designed to automate monthly attendance tracking by reducing manual work and improving accuracy.
The system allows users to select any month from a drop-down list, after which the attendance dates, weekdays, and summaries update automatically.
This project reflects real-world Excel usage commonly required in HR, Admin, and MIS roles.
